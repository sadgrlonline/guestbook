# Guestbook

This is a little demo code to go along with my [PHP 101 Project: Building a Guestbook](https://learn.sadgrl.online/php-project-building-a-guestbook/). 

This page gives you all of the information you should need to build your own (as long as you have access to a webserver with PHP and SQL).

Anyone is free to use this for their own project.

The file included called **guestbook.sql** holds the database schema for the project, but the tutorial linked above also goes over how to set this up.
